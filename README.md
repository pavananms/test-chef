# test-chef
a small simple and yet uncomplete code :(

test.py is the result of a days work by me tackling a simple question in code chef.As my every othe day to day activity...its incomplete...:P

the question is to accept many numbers as input..limit being 100 numbers.And out put them following a blank line.
A slight twist though...If 42 is in the input. No number after 42 should be printed as output..

My code is successful....If it wasnt for that 42..:( :(
